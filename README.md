## DESCRIPTION

It's time to put everything that you've learned in the past month together! For your first project, you will build a full stack web application using jQuery and AJAX, Express, Node.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB.

## OBJECTIVES

* Apply the skills you've learned by building a full-stack web application from the ground up.
* Demonstrate mastery of topics covered during this course so far.  
* Build a polished, published website you can share in your portfolio.  

You will be working in pairs for this project. Remember to communicate, communicate, communicate.  Show us what you've got!

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS


### Core Technical Requirements

**Your app should have all of the following:**



* **Express API** Build an Express Application that has both HTML and JSON endpoints.
* **RESTful Routes** Design your CRUD routes using the [REST](http://restfulrouting.com/mappings/resources) convention.
* **AJAX** Leverage AJAX to fetch JSON data from the backend.
* **jQuery** Use jQuery to add interactivity and render data on the client-side.  
* **Templating** Render the JSON data on the front end using handlebars templates.  
* **MongoDB** Persist at least two models to a Mongo Database. One must have full CRUD.  
* **Git** 50+ commits. Commit early, commit often. Tell a story with your commits. Each message should give a clear idea what you changed. (And don't expose any secret API keys/tokens on GitHub!)
* **Code Style** Write professional-looking code. Use a consistent style. Consider following the [Airbnb Javascript Styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/es5).
* **Visual Design** Make your front-end snazzy by adding custom styling. First impressions matter!
* **Heroku** Deploy your app to Heroku.
* **Documentation** Write a README.md that would make an employer excited to hire you. Screenshots are encouraged. See the [example readme](./example-readme.md) for a suggested structure.


### Flex Technical Requirements

**Your app should have 2 of the 5 following options:**
* **External API** Use an external API to integrate rich data into your app.
* **Model Relationship** Create a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship between two models using either embedded or referenced data.
* **Authentication** Enable users to sign up, log in, and log out. (Note: This is very difficult.)
* **Data Validation** On the client side, don't let users submit blank forms -- and give them a visible error message explaining why they weren't allowed to submit.  In your database, use mongoose's validations for at least one attribute for each of your schemas (see <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html">mongoose validation docs</a>). You can meet this requirement with just mongoose's built-in validations, but you could also take it further with custom validations.
* **Bootstrap** Use Twitter Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton, or another CSS framework throughout your site to create a unified baseline style.


## PLANNING DELIVERABLES

See the [planning deliverables](./planning.md) document for more information on the planning steps you should take.
  * A clearly defined **Minimum Viable Product ([MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)) Scope**. What can you reasonably accomplish in a week?  
  * **Wireframes** and **site flow**. These don't have to be pretty; just sketch what the main pages will include and how the user will navigate from page to page.
  * **User Stories** - we recommend [Trello](https://trello.com/) for project tracking.
  * **Database** List the attributes you'll include in your schemas.
  * A **Feasibility Check** for any bonus feature you'd like to complete, including external APIs.

Once your project has been approved, one member of your group should create a **GitHub Repo** for your project and [add your partner as a  collaborator](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/).

## BONUS IDEAS  
If you want to push yourself and learn something new, optionally consider doing some of the following with your app, but *please talk to an instructor* beforehand:

* **Front-End Data Validation** Validate data on the front-end by handling incorrect form inputs during create/update. For example, when a form is submitted, check that a field has some text in it, or that its value is a number.
* **Back-End Data Validation** Validate data on the back-end using mongoose's [built-in validations](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html#built-in-validators), or make your own custom validation.
* **More Models or Relationships** Add another model to your project or create a new relationship.
* **Model Methods** Level up your models by adding a method to one of your schemas.  For example, a person schema with `firstName` and `lastName` can have a `fullName` method (see mongoose docs on [instance methods](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#methods) and [static methods](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#statics)).
* **Sass** Use a CSS pre-compiler to write more imperative CSS.

## TIMELINE

> DO NOT START CODING UNTIL YOU HAVE GONE OVER YOUR PROJECT PLAN WITH AN INSTRUCTOR.

* **Wednesday, September 7th by 3:00pm** - Present your app plan to an instructor to go over your [planning deliverables](./planning.md).
* **Weekdays, September 8th-12th** - Technical interview prep at 9:00AM. Project work time for the rest of the day. Daily check-ins with your team's instructor.
* **Tuesday, September 13th @ 1:15pm** - Project due and presentations!

In addition, we suggest you have a Feature Freeze on Monday, September 12th! Deploy your code to Heroku, and focus on polishing existing features, your README.md, and presentations.

## FEEDBACK

####Code must be...
* Clean   
  - no unused or commented-out code   
  - proper spacing and indentation  
* Modular and well organized   
  - use `module.exports` and `require` to organize code in separate files
  - separate large tasks into shorter functions
* Appropriately commented
  - use comments to plan, but remove the unnecessary comments for your professional portfolio
  - prefer a well-named variable or function to a comment

See the [feedback document](./feedback.md) for the criteria on which your project will be evaluated.

##FINAL DELIVERABLES

* Completion of the **technical requirements**
* A `README.md` file that serves as your **project documentation** (this is important!)
   - A link to your website **hosted on Heroku**
   - A link to your **source code on GitHub**
* A **brief presentation**, in the company of friends, illustrating:
    - Triumphs
    - Challenges
    - Words of Wisdom
    - And _3_ lines(!) of code you want to share with your classmates, copied into a separate document (like your reamde)

Each developer MUST present half of your presentation.

###HAPPY CODING :)
