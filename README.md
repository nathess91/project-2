## DESCRIPTION

It's time to put everything that you've learned in the past month together! For your first project, you will build a full stack web application using jQuery and AJAX, Express, Node.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB.

## OBJECTIVES

* Apply the skills you've learned by building a full-stack web application from the ground up.
* Demonstrate mastery of topics covered during this course so far.  
* Build a polished, published website you can share in your portfolio.  

You will be working in pairs for this project. Remember to communicate, communicate, communicate.  Show us what you've got!

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

* **Express API** Build an Express Application that has both HTML and JSON endpoints.
* **RESTful Routes** Design your CRUD routes using the [REST](http://restfulrouting.com/mappings/resources) convention.
* **AJAX** Leverage AJAX to fetch JSON data from the backend.
* **jQuery** Use jQuery to add interactivity and render data on the client-side.  
* **Templating** Render the JSON data on the front end using handlebars templates.  
* **MongoDB** Persist at least two models to a Mongo Database. Use at least one one-to-many or many-to-many relationship between models. You can choose to reference or embed your data.  
* **Git** 50+ commits. Commit early, commit often. Tell a story with your commits. Each message should give a clear idea what you changed. (And don't expose any secret keys/tokens on GitHub!)
* **Code Style** Write professional-looking code. Follow the [Airbnb Javascript Styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/es5).
* **Visual Design** Use Twitter Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton, or another CSS framework to make your front-end snazzy, but also add custom styling. First impressions matter!
* **Heroku** Deploy your app to Heroku.
* **Documentation** Write a README.md that would make an employer excited to hire you. Screenshots are encouraged. See the [example readme](./example-readme.md) for a suggested structure.

## PLANNING DELIVERABLES

See the [planning deliverables](./planning.md) document for more information on the planning steps you should take.
  * A clearly defined **Minimum Viable Product ([MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)) Scope**. What can you reasonably accomplish in a week?  
  * **Wireframes** and **site flow**. These don't have to be pretty; just sketch what the main pages will include and how the user will navigate from page to page.
  * **User Stories** - we recommend [Trello](https://trello.com/) for project tracking.
  * **Database** List the attributes you'll include in your schema(s).
  * A **Feasibility Check** for any bonus feature you'd like to complete, including external APIs.

Once your project has been approved, one member of your group should create a **GitHub Repo** for your project and [add your partner as a  collaborator](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/).

## BONUS IDEAS  
If you want to push yourself and learn something new, optionally consider doing some of the following with your app, but *please talk to an instructor* beforehand:

* **Front-End Data Validation** Validate data on the front-end by handling incorrect form inputs during create/update. For example, when a form is submitted, check that a field has some text in it, or that its value is a number.
* **Back-End Data Validation** Validate data on the back-end using mongoose's [built-in validations](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html#built-in-validators), or make your own custom validation.
* **More Models or Relationships** Add another model to your project or create a new relationship.
* **External API** Use an external API to integrate rich data into your app.
* **Model Methods** Level up your models by adding a method to one of your schemas.  For example, a person schema with `firstName` and `lastName` can have a `fullName` method (see mongoose docs on [instance methods](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#methods) and [static methods](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html#statics)).
* **Authentication** Enable users to store account information and signup, login, and logout.
* **Sass** Use a CSS pre-compiler to write more imperative CSS.

## TIMELINE

> DO NOT START CODING UNTIL YOU HAVE GONE OVER YOUR PROJECT PLAN WITH AN INSTRUCTOR.

* **Wednesday, September 7th by 3:00pm** - Present your app plan an instructor to go over your [planning deliverables](./planning.md).
* **Weekdays, September 7th-11th** - Technical Interview prep at 9:00AM. Project work time for the rest of the day. Daily check-ins with your team's instructor.
* **Tuesday, September 12th @ 1:15pm** - Project due and presentations!

In addition, we suggest you have a Feature Freeze on Monday, September 11th! Deploy your code to Heroku, and focus on polishing existing features, your README.md, and presentations.

## FEEDBACK

####Code must be...
* Clean   
  - no unused or commented-out code   
  - proper spacing and indentation  
* Modular and well organized   
  - use `module.exports` and `require` to organize code in separate files
  - separate large tasks into shorter functions
* Appropriately commented
  - use comments to plan, but remove the unnecessary comments for your professional portfolio
  - prefer a well-named variable or function to a comment

See the [feedback document](./feedback.md) for the criteria on which your project will be evaluated.

## ACCESS TO INSTRUCTORS
We will check in with groups throughout project week. We will also do mini lessons on certain topics if we notice that several people are running into the same issues.

##FINAL DELIVERABLES

* Completion of the **core requirements**
* A link to your website **hosted on Heroku**
* A link to your **source code on GitHub**
* A `README.md` file that serves as your **project documentation** (this is important!)
* A **brief presentation**, in the company of friends, illustrating:
    - Triumphs
    - Challenges
    - Words of Wisdom
    - And _3_ lines(!) of code you want to share with your classmates, copied into a separate document (like your reamde).

Each developer MUST present half of your presentation.

###HAPPY CODING :)
